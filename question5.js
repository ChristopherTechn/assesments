let sum = 5+ 5+"5";

console.log(sum); //105

//The results of the sum will be 105 this because, in the sum expression
//we have two integers and we also have a string. The first two 5 are integers
//because they are not enclosed unlike the third 5 which is enclosed by quotation 
//marks and makes it is a string.when you run the first two integers will be added
// to give 10 then the string which is 5 will be placed next to the 
//10 to make it look like 105.
